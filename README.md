# Awesome AIoT

A curated, but incomplete, list of AIoT resources. It should be noted that it is unfeasible to encompass every paper. Thus, we prefer to selectively choose papers that present a range of distinct ideas. We welcome contributions to further enrich and refine this list.

Veneus: 
- mobile conferences (MobiCom/MobiSys/SenSys/UbiComp)
- network conferences (NSDI/SIGCOMM) 
- core system conferences (OSDI/SOSP/EuroSys/ASPLOS/ATC)
- AI conferences (MLSys, NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ACL)
