# Awesome AIoT

A curated, but incomplete, list of AIoT resources. It should be noted that it is unfeasible to encompass every paper. Thus, we prefer to selectively choose papers that present a range of distinct ideas. We welcome contributions to further enrich and refine this list.

Veneus: system conferences (OSDI/SOSP/ATC/EuroSys/ASPLOS), network conferences (NSDI/SIGCOMM) and mobile conferences (MobiCom/MobiSys/SenSys/UbiComp).
